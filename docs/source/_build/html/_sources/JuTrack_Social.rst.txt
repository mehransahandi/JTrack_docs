Passive Monitoring:
-------------------
In passive monitoring modules, the assessment will continue without any interaction from users. 
The following passive monitoring modules will collect data over specified criteria or time period automatically.

|

.. _labelLocationService: 

Location Service
+++++++++++++++++

location service records the user's relative location in a specified time period (i.e. every 10 minutes) or whenever there is a change is the user's location. 
for an energy-efficient implementation JuTrack benefits `Google's location service API <https://developer.android.com/training/location>`_ 
also, to meet the requirements of security and privacy, the location transformed in 3D space randomly for each user. 
this transformation is hidden for users and study owners which can not be reverted.

|

.. _labelUserActivityDetection: 

User Activity Detection
+++++++++++++++++++++++
It detects users mode of transportation, for an efficient implementation JuTrack benefits `Google's activity detection API <https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/ActivityRecognitionClient>`_  
in this module, JuTrack is able to detect up to 7 different activities every specified time (i.e.every 5 minutes ) or whenever a new activity detected. 
the list of activities is as follow:

* IN_VEHICLE
* ON_BICYCLE 
* ON_FOOT
* STILL   
* UNKNOWN
